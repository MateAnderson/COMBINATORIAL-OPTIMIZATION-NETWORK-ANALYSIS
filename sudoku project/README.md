In this mini project we want to: 
- Sovle the classic 9*9 Sudoku problem using *Interger Programming*
- Send/Recieved data to/from *GAMS* software using *Python AIP*
----------------------

1. Sovle the classic 9*9 Sudoku problem using *Interger Programming*:
For getting more insight about the mathematical model you can read the report file.
"su.gms" file is the implementaion a sudoku with GAMS software. Each line has a comment for better navigation through the code.

2. Send/Recieved data to/from *GAMS* software using *Python AIP*

[Link to the official documentation of the gams software and its python API](https://www.gams.com/33/docs/API_PY_TUTORIAL.html)
[If you have a different version python check this tutorial out to setup another version of py on your local machine without causing any conflict](https://www.gams.com/33/docs/API_PY_TUTORIAL.html)
